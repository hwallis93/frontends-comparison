# Frontend Comparisons

This repo points to several others in which I've written (or intend to write!) the same app using different languages/frameworks:

- [TypeScript + React](https://github.com/hwallis93/pixel-art-typescript-react)
- [ReScript + React](https://github.com/hwallis93/pixel-art-rescript-react)
- [Rust + Yew](https://github.com/hwallis93/pixel-art-rust-yew)
- [Rust + Seed](https://github.com/hwallis93/pixel-art-rust-seed)

Point of this was to mess about with a few different frameworks on an app that was simple but non-trivial. I've also tried to include features that involve using a broad range of tools.
This allowed vaguely "real world" comparison between them, rather than just looking at the different syntax for doing a basic counter app or whatever.
